# Trivia
This was a project that a colleague and I did when I was a sophomore. The game is basically a trivia game that features music, history, movies, and sports. I am going to improve by adding more features to it, but I am going to make some minor changes before adding new features to my game. 

## Description
Their will be a PDF file to explain what the code does. You can use version control to see the original code and how I improved upon it.
