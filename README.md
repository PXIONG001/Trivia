# Trivia
This was a project that a colleague and I did when I was a sophomore in college. The game is basically a trivia game that features music, history, movies, and sports. I am going to improve by adding more features to it, but I am going to make some minor changes before adding new features to my game. 

## Description
The Trivia game is a computer program in which a person can play the game using the command line. This project is built using python with a database connectivity in postgres.

### How to Play
1. In order to activate the program, you will need to have your command line open and have python on your computer. (You will need to type most of the time when you play this game. I recommend that you use copy and paste to make it faster).
2. The user will need to have a username and login to play the game, and, when they have already login, the user will have an option to play what game is presented to them. 
3. There are 4 trivia topics: history, music, sports, and movies. (Note: some of them are not up to date, but I will bring some updates in the long run).
4.  3 of the trivia games have images that will appear to the users while the music trivia will have music play on their Personal Computer (PC) to help the users guess the answer.
5.  When you are finished playing the game, you will have score that is presented to you in which it presents your score.
